Bookbot is my first project!

- Update -

Added functions that; opens a file via a path, gets the number of words, counts the total characters into a dictionary that also filters out special characters, converts that dictionary into a list and allocates them into a list for characters and their counts using the .items() method, sorts the characters by frequency and finally prints a report in a desired format
