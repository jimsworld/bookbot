Bookbot is my first project!

- Update -

Created functions that:

- Opens a file via a path.
- Gets the number of words.
- Counts the total characters.
  Adds this into an empty dictionary and filters out special characters.
- Converts that dictionary into a list and allocates them into a new list
  for characters and their counts using the .items() method.
- Sorts the characters by frequency.
- Prints a report in a desired format.

- Update 2 -

Created new functions "Mini Tasks" that:

- Returns the first 100 characters.
- Produced the first 10 words.
- Counts the total digits with the same logic that counts characters.
- Prints all of the new Mini Tasks above.
